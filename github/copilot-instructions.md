# Copilot Instruction

Write JavaScript code according to the following rules:

- Follow ES6+ syntax.
- Avoid global variables.
- Write clean, small functions.
- Write JSDoc comments above each function.
- Don't use third-party libraries unless necessary.
- The code should be clear and well-structured.

Tests:
- Use Jest for unit tests.
- Use MSW (Mock Service Worker) for mocking API calls in tests.
- Write tests using jest and msw. Create a folder "__tests__" and add tests inside it.
- When it's an integration test, write in the style of a user story. Example: User -> clicks on a button and sees loading.
